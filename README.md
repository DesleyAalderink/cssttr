# Week 1 - The beginning
I started the assignment by just diving into the code. This didn't work for me, because I didn't knew what I really wanted. I grabbed sheets op paper and started making designs. At first I was stuck making basic designs, which weren't really pretty. That's when I made multiple designs, which I normally would never make. I went with the design where the nav is on the left. I started making a basic set up.

## CSS grid
For the assignment we needed to use CSS grid. I went online and started doing "CSS Grid Garden", which is a game that helps you practise grid. I got the basic idea, but still was clueless on how to begin. I searched online for a video tutorial. I found a really good one that goes into the basics of CSS grids. I started making notes on things that were usefull/interesting. And soon after I started making a basic grid in the website.

## Sick...
unfortunately, I started getting sick on thursday. I started losing focus on around 14:00. I couldn't focus of think because of a headache and I started to feel dizzy. I didn't really got any progress on that day. I want to work on this assignment in the weekend to make up for lost time.

# Week 2 - started from the bottom and we're still there...
Because of my ongoing sickness I didn't got any work done. I'm really begind. I also started from scratch, just to play with css grid. I will keep trying. Giving up is for losers.

# Retry
I took the website I made for Webdesign and decided to use this for my CSSTTR retry. The people I'm focusing on with this project on people who are disabled. The original project was made for Larissa, she was blind. But the website is accessible for people who are:

* Deaf
* Spastic
* Blind

The first main thing I needed to do was change all my classes and ID's. My website needed to be semantic. Calling everything in the CSS was not that difficult.
I used a lot of "nth-child" and other CSS selectors to call every object.
I made the side more friendly by adding A LOT of ":hover" and ":focus" states. I also changed the mouse to a real mouse. Seems fitting for my concept.
I made a custom checkbox in the style of my website so it doesn't look bland. I made the website responsive so it looks good on mobile phones as well.
This is important for the user case I have for my site. I also made the hitbox bigger for the "a href" for mobile phone. This is more easy to use.
The last button on the website is a button that "doesn't work". I made this button blurry together with the text "deze knop doet het niet" to give the user
the implication that the button doesn't work. If however, the user does click the button it will repeatedly show a random background color. I like it.

# Conclusion
I learned a lot from CSSTTR. I like CSS a lot, so I worked with a lot of fun. I learned new CSS selectors and made a website I'm really proud of. In the future I want to continue working in this style, because its like a puzzle.
