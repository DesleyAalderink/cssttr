# Week 1 - The beginning
I started the assignment by just diving into the code. This didn't work for me, because I didn't knew what I really wanted. I grabbed sheets op paper and started making designs. At first I was stuck making basic designs, which weren't really pretty. That's when I made multiple designs, which I normally would never make. I went with the design where the nav is on the left. I started making a basic set up.

## CSS grid
For the assignment we needed to use CSS grid. I went online and started doing "CSS Grid Garden", which is a game that helps you practise grid. I got the basic idea, but still was clueless on how to begin. I searched online for a video tutorial. I found a really good one that goes into the basics of CSS grids. I started making notes on things that were usefull/interesting. And soon after I started making a basic grid in the website.

## Sick...
unfortunately, I started getting sick on thursday. I started losing focus on around 14:00. I couldn't focus of think because of a headache and I started to feel dizzy. I didn't really got any progress on that day. I want to work on this assignment in the weekend to make up for lost time.
